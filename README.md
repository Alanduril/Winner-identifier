Soon, you will try to create your own Tic Tac Toe game, so let's prepare a bit!


This time, you have to write only a checker for the game. It will be a method that takes a 2D array and returns a boolean. If there is a winner, it returns true otherwise false.


We use "X" and "O" as signs of our players. The empty places will be filled with numbers from 1 to 9.

You have to check 3 types of cases:

    horizontal;

    vertical;

    diagonal;

Hint: you can use more than one condition inside of one if, and don't hesitate to use loop;
